# Services to preconfigure

    - Route53
    - SES
    - Profile (IAM Service) in your local machine: impactes-mobile-terraform-user
        if you want to make changes directly to aws infra without passing by github process (not recommended), you use CLI CMDs
            CLI: AWS_PROFILE=impactes-mobile-terraform-user terraform init
            CLI: AWS_PROFILE=impactes-mobile-terraform-user terraform plan
            CLI: AWS_PROFILE=impactes-mobile-terraform-user terraform apply
            Or simply : export AWS_PROFILE=impactes-mobile-terraform-user
            terraform init
            terraform plan
            terraform apply
    - SSL Certificate must also be created in the Certificate Manager in us-east-1 region (must be in this region even if our project is in eu-west-1) and copy its arn in the modules/cloudfront/locals.impactes-mobile_fr_ssl_ca_arn
    - Some secrets must also be created in the Secrets Manager in AWS, there secrets are referenced in the file: modules/ecs/ecs.tf
    Secret arn must retrieved from AWS Console and used in the: modules/ecs/ecs.tf

The terraform.tfvars is the file where we put sensitive variable values that will not be pushed to github but essential for
terraform locally if you decide to make changes directly to aws without passing by github CI/CD process (forbidden)

# Setup

    1- If you want to make some changes to state (not recommended), you can do it in (state/dev & state/prod): AWS_PROFILE=impactes-mobile-terraform-user terraform init/plan/apply

    3- You push feature branch to repo, when approved, you can merge it to "dev", if all is ok, you make PR to merge to "prod"

    2- You can directly update terraform by using CLI commands and your aws profile (not recommended)
